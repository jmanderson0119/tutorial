# Tutorial

This is a dive into the Github tutorial for Github and Git. I have an abstracted idea of what these applications are, but I would like to refine my skills with them, so I'm going through the Github docs in my spare time.

>As per the tutorial, I should write something about myself. I was born in Reno, Nevada and was raised in [Mesa, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa,_Arizona) for almost my entire life. I moved to Cleveland to study Computer Science because I believe in the mission statement of the [university](https://case.edu/) and have loved being here since. Some of my interests include AI, boxing, chess, Dungeons and Dragons, game development, mathematics, rock climbing, wrestling/grappling, and so on.
